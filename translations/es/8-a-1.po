"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>Aid for Trade commitments and disbursements is the gross disbursements "
"and commitments of total Official Development Assistance (ODA) from all "
"donors for aid for trade.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>The DAC defines Official Development Assistance (ODA) as &#x201C;those "
"flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to "
"multilateral institutions which are i) provided by official agencies, "
"including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and "
"ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic "
"development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and "
"is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per "
"cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent). (See <a href="
"\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/"
"officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm\">http://www.oecd.org/"
"dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm</a>)</p>\n"
"<p>Other official flows (OOF),excluding officially supported export credits, "
"are defined as transactions by the official sector which do not meet the "
"conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not primarily "
"aimed at development, or because they are not sufficiently concessional. See "
