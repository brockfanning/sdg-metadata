"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>This indicator conveys the contribution of manufacturing in total "
"employment. It measures the ability of the manufacturing sector to absorb "
"surplus labour forces from agricultural and other traditional sectors "
"towards production labour with higher wages, when monitored over time. "
"However, in developed countries an opposite trend is expected where emphasis "
"has shifted to reduction in labor in manufacturing as part of cost-cutting "
"measures, to promote more capital-intensive industries. </p>"

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"

"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>The characteristics of the data source impact the international "
"comparability of the data, especially in cases where the coverage of the "
"source is less than comprehensive (either in terms of country territory or "
"economic activities). In the absence of a labour force survey (the preferred "
"source of data for this indicator), some countries may use an establishment "
"survey to derive this indicator, but these usually have a minimum "
"establishement size cut-off point and small units which are not officially "
"registered (whether in manufacturing or not) would thus not be included in "
"the survey. Consequently, employment data may be underestimated. "
"Discrepancies can also be caused by differences in the definition of "
"employment or the working&#x2013;age population. </p>"

msgid ""
"<h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>Multivariate regression and cross-validation techniques are used to "
"impute missing values at the country level. The additional variables used "
"for the imputation include a range of indicators, including labour market "
"and economic data. However, the imputed missing country values are only used "
"to calculate the global and regional estimates; they are not used for "
"international reporting on the SDG indicators by the ILO. For a more "
"detailed methodological description, please refer to Trends Econometric "
"Models: A Review of Methodology (ILO, Geneva, 2010), available at <a href="

"</ul>\n"
"<p>The aggregates are derived from the Trends Econometric Models (TEM) that "
"are used to produce global and regional estimates of, amongst others, "
"employment by economic activity. These models use multivariate regression "
"and cross-validation techniques to impute missing values at the country "
"level, which are then aggregated to produce regional and global estimates. "
"The regional and global shares of employment in manufacturing are obtained "
"by first adding up, across countries, the numerator and denominator of the "
"formula that defines the manufacturing employment as a proportion of total "
"employment - outlined above. Once both magnitudes are produced at the "
"desired level of aggregation, the ratio between the two is used to compute "
"the share for each regional grouping and the global level. Notice that this "
"direct aggregation method can be used due to the imputation of missing "
"observations. For further information on the TEM, please refer to the "
"technical background papers available at: <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/"
