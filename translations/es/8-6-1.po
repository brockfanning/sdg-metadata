"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>This indicator conveys the proportion of youth (aged 15-24 years) not in "
"education, employment or training (also known as &quot;the youth NEET "
"rate&quot;).</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>For the purposes of this indicator, youth is defined as all persons "
"between the ages of 15 and 24 (inclusive).</p>\n"
"<p>According to the International Standard Classification of Education "
"(ISCED), education is defined as organized and sustained communication "
"designed to bring about learning. Formal education is defined in ISCED as "
"education that is institutionalized, intentional, and planned through public "
"organizations and recognized private bodies and, in their totality, make up "
"the formal education system of a country.</p>\n"
"<p>Non-formal education, like formal education is defined in ISCED as "
"education that is institutionalized, intentional and planned by an education "
"provider but is considered an addition, alternative and/or a complement to "
"formal education. It may be short in duration and/or low in intensity and it "
"is typically provided in the form of short courses, workshops or seminars. "
"Informal learning is defined in ISCED as forms of learning that are "
"intentional or deliberate, but not institutionalized. It is thus less "
"organized and less structured than either formal or non-formal education. "
"Informal learning may include learning activities that occur in the family, "
"in the work place, in the local community, and in daily life, on a self-"
"directed, family-directed or socially-directed basis. For the purposes of "
"this indicator, persons will be considered in education if they are in "
"formal or non-formal education, as described above, but excluding informal "
"learning.</p>\n"
"<p>Persons in employment are defined as all those who, during a short "
"reference period, such as one week or one day, performed work for others in "
"exchange for pay or profit. </p>\n"
"<p>For the purposes of this indicator, persons are considered to be in "
"training if they are in a non-academic learning activity through which they "
"acquire specific skills intended for vocational or technical jobs.</p>\n"
"<p>Vocational training prepares trainees for jobs that are based on manual "
"or practical activities, and for skilled operative jobs, both blue and white "
"collar related to a specific trade, occupation or vocation. Technical "
"training on the other hand imparts learning that can be applied in "
"intermediate-level jobs, in particular those of technicians and middle "
"managers. The coverage of vocational and technical training includes only "
"programmes that are solely school-based vocational and technical training. "
"Employer-based training is, by definition, excluded from the scope of this "
"indicator.</p>"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>The share of youth not in employment, education or training (youth NEET "
"rate) provides a measure of youth who are outside the educational system, "
"not in training and not in employment, and thus serves as a broader measure "
"of potential youth labour market entrants than youth unemployment. It "
"includes discouraged worker youth as well as those who are outside the "
"labour force due to disability and engagement in household chores, among "
"other reasons. NEET is also a better measure of the current universe of "
"potential youth labour market entrants as compared with the youth inactivity "
"rate, as the latter includes those youth who are outside the labour force "
"and are in education, and thus are furthering their skills and "
"qualifications.</p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>The calculation of this indicator requires to have reliable information "
"on both the labour market status and the participation in education or "
"training of young persons. The quality of such information is heavily "
"dependent on the questionnaire design, the sample size and design and the "
"accuracy of respondents&apos; answers. </p>\n"
"<p>In terms of the analysis of the indicator, in order to avoid "
"misinterpreting it, it is important to bear in mind that it is composed of "
"two different sub-groups (unemployed youth not in education or training and "
"youth outside the labour force not in education or training). The prevalence "
"and composition of each sub-group would have policy implications, and thus, "
"should also be considered when analysing the NEET rate.</p>"

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>Youth NEET rate =</p>\n"
"<p>(Youth &#x2013; (Youth in employment + Youth not in employment but in "
"education or training))/Youth) x 100</p>\n"
"<p>It is important to note here that youth simultaneously in employment and "
"education or training should not be double counted when subtracted from the "
"total number of youth.</p>\n"
"<p>The formula can also be expressed as:</p>\n"
"<p>Youth NEET rate =</p>\n"
"<p>((Unemployed youth + Youth outside the labour force) &#x2013; (Unemployed "
"youth in education or training + Youth outside the labour force in education "
"or training)) Youth x 100</p>"

msgid ""
"<h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>Multivariate regression and cross-validation techniques are used to "
"impute missing values at the country level. The additional variables used "
"for the imputation include a range of indicators, including labour market "
"and school enrolment data. However, the imputed missing country values are "
"only used to calculate the global and regional estimates; they are not used "
"for international reporting on the SDG indicators by the ILO. </p>\n"

msgctxt "REG_AGG"
msgid ""
"<h2>Regional aggregates:</h2>\n"
"<p>The NEET aggregates are derived from the Trends Econometric Models (TEM) "
"that are used to produce global and regional estimates of, amongst others, "
"rates of youth not in employment. These models use multivariate regression "
"and cross-validation techniques to impute missing values at the country "
"level, which are then aggregated to produce regional and global estimates. "
"The regional and global NEET rates are obtained by first adding up, across "
"countries, the numerator and denominator of the formula that defines NEET "
"rates - outlined above. Once both magnitudes are produced at the desired "
"level of aggregation, the ratio between the two is used to produce the NEET "
"rate for each regional grouping and the global level. Notice that this "
"direct aggregation method can be used due to the imputation of missing "
"observations. For further information on the TEM, please refer to the "
"technical background papers available at: <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/"
