"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"

"<p>The methods with agreed international standards have been developed, "

"<p>The methods used for the analysis of causes of death depend on the type "
"of data available from countries. </p>\n"
"<p>For countries with a high-quality vital registration system including "
"information on cause of death, the vital registration that member states "
"submit to the WHO Mortality Database were used, with adjustments where "
"necessary, e.g. for under-reporting of deaths.</p>\n"
"<p>For countries without high-quality death registration data, cause of "
"death estimates are calculated using other data, including household surveys "
"with verbal autopsy, sample or sentinel registration systems, special "
"studies and surveillance systems. In most cases, these data sources are "
"combined in a modelling framework.</p>\n"
