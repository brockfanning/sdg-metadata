"<p>UNODC collects data on prisons through its annual data collection (UN-"
"CTS). The data collection through the UN-CTS is facilitated by a network of "
"over 130 national Focal Points appointed by responsible authorities. Data on "
"unsentenced and total detainees from the UN-CTS are available for 114 "
"countries. The country coverage can improve if other sources (research "
"institutions and NGOs) are included (data for additional 60 countries are "
"available, bringing the total for the period 2012-2014 to 174 countries). "
"Data for two points in time (2003-2005 and 2012-2014 three year averages) "
"are available for 144 countries.</p>"

msgctxt "COLL_METHOD"

"<p><strong>Collection process:</strong></p>\n"
"<p>There is a consolidated system of annual data collection on crime and "
"criminal justice (UN- Crime Trends Survey, UN-CTS) which represents the "
"basis of data on unsentenced detainees. The UN-CTS data collection is "
"largely based on the network of national Focal Points, which are "
"institutions/officials appointed by countries and having the technical "
"capacity and role to produce data on crime and criminal justice (around 130 "
"appointed Focal Points as of 2016). In addition, these data are supplemented "
"for countries with missing values with official data collected by the "
"Institute for Criminal Policy Research (World Prison Brief), which collects "
"data directly from national prison administrations or from the websites of "
"Ministries of Justice or other official agencies. For future SDG reporting "
"data will be sent to countries for consultation prior to publication.</p>"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator signifies overall respect for the principle that persons "
"awaiting trial shall not be detained in custody unnecessarily. This, in "
"turn, is premised on aspects of the right to be presumed innocent until "
"proven guilty. From a development perspective, extensive use of pre-sentence "
"detention when not necessary for reasons such as the prevention of "
"absconding, the protection of victims or witnesses, or the prevention of the "
"commission of further offences, can divert criminal justice system "
"resources, and exert financial and unemployment burdens on the accused and "
"his or her family. Measuring the relative extent to which pre-sentence "
"detention is used can provide the evidence to assist countries in lowering "
"such burdens and ensuring its proportionate use.</p>"

"<h2>Regional aggregates:</h2>\n"
"<p>Weighted averages are the preferred method for calculating regional and "
"global average rates. For this purpose, regional averages of the proportion "
"of unsentenced detainees are obtained by adding up the number of unsentenced "
"persons held in the region and dividing the total by the sum of the total "
"number of persons held in detention in the region. Similarly, global "
"averages of the proportion of unsentenced detainees are obtained by adding "
"up the number of unsentenced persons held globally and dividing the total by "
"the sum of the total number of persons held in detention globally.</p>"
