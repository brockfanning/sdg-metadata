"<h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>\n"
"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator is defined as the installed capacity of power plants that "
"generate electricity from renewable energy sources divided by the total "
"population of a country. Capacity is defined as the net maximum electrical "
"capacity installed at the year-end and renewable energy sources are as "
"defined in the IRENA Statute (see concepts below). </p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>Electricity capacity is defined in the International Recommendations for "
"Energy Statistics or IRES (UN, 2018) as the maximum active power that can be "
"supplied continuously (i.e., throughout a prolonged period in a day with the "
"whole plant running) at the point of outlet (i.e., after taking the power "
"supplies for the station auxiliaries and allowing for the losses in those "
"transformers considered integral to the station). This assumes no "
"restriction of interconnection to the network. It does not include overload "
"capacity that can only be sustained for a short period of time (e.g., "
"internal combustion engines momentarily running above their rated capacity)."
"</p>\n"
"<p>The IRENA Statute defines renewable energy to include energy from the "
"following sources: hydropower; marine energy (ocean, tidal and wave energy); "
"wind energy; solar energy (photovoltaic and thermal energy); bioenergy; and "
"geothermal energy.</p>"

"<h1>Data sources</h1>\n"
"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p>IRENA&#x2019;s electricity capacity database contains information about "
"the electricity generating capacity installed at the year-end, measured in "
"MW. The dataset covers all countries and areas from the year 2000 onwards. "
"The dataset also records whether the capacity is on-grid or off-grid and is "
"split into 36 different renewable energy types that can be aggregated into "
"the six main sources of renewable energy. </p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "COLL_METHOD"
msgid ""
"<h2>Collection process:</h2>\n"
"<p>The capacity data is collected as part of IRENA&#x2019;s annual "
"questionnaire cycle. Questionnaires are sent to countries at the start of a "
"year asking for renewable energy data for two years previously (i.e. at the "
"start of 2019, questionnaires ask for data for the year 2017). The data is "
"then validated and checked with countries and published in the IRENA "
"Renewable Energy Statistics Yearbook at the end of June. To minimise "
"reporting burden, the questionnaires for some countries are pre-filled with "
"data collected by other agencies (e.g. Eurostat) and are sent to countries "
"for them to complete any additional details requested by IRENA.</p>\n"
"<p>At the same time as this, preliminary estimates of capacity for the "
"previous year are also collected from official sources where available (e.g. "
"national statistics, data from electricity grid operators) and from other "
"unofficial sources (mostly industry associations for the different renewable "
"energy sectors). These are published at the end of March. </p>\n"
"<h2>Population data:</h2>\n"
"<p>For the population part of this indicator, IRENA uses a 6-source "
"consolidation by the World Bank, which is available through the World "
"Bank&#x2019;s World Development Indicators database. The indicator reflects "
"the residents in a country or area regardless of legal status or "
"citizenship. The values are midyear estimates.</p>\n"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>The infrastructure and technologies required to supply modern and "
"sustainable energy services cover a wide range of equipment and devices that "
"are used across numerous economic sectors. There is no readily available "
"mechanism to collect, aggregate and measure the contribution of this "
"disparate group of products to the delivery of modern and sustainable energy "
"services. However, one major part of the energy supply chain that can be "
"readily measured is the infrastructure used to produce electricity. </p>\n"
"<p> </p>\n"
"<p>Renewables are considered a sustainable form of energy supply, as their "
"current use does not usually deplete their availability to be used in the "
"future. The focus of this indicator on electricity reflects the emphasis in "
"the target on modern sources of energy and is particularly relevant for "
"developing countries where the demand for electricity is often high and its "
"availability is constrained. Furthermore, the focus on renewables reflects "
"the fact that the technologies used to produce renewable electricity are "
"generally modern and more sustainable than non-renewables, particularly in "
"the fastest growing sub-sectors of electricity generation from wind and "
"solar energy.</p>\n"
"<p>The division of renewable electricity capacity by population (to produce "
"a measure of Watts per capita) is proposed to scale the capacity data to "
"account for the large variation in needs between countries. It uses "
"population rather than GDP to scale the data, because this is the most basic "
"indicator of the demand for modern and sustainable energy services in a "
"country.</p>\n"
"<p>This indicator should also complement indicators 7.1.1 and 7.2. With "
"respect to electricity access, it will provide additional information to the "
"proportion of people with electricity access by showing how much "
"infrastructure is available to deliver that access (in terms of the amount "
"of capacity per person). The focus on renewable capacity will also add-value "
"to the existing renewables indicator (7.2) by showing how much renewable "
"energy is contributing to the need for improved electricity access.</p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>At present, electricity only accounts for about one-quarter of total "
"energy use in the World and an even lower share of energy use in most "
"developing countries. The focus of this indicator on electricity capacity "
"does not capture any trends in the modernisation of technologies used to "
"produce heat or provide energy for transport.</p>\n"
"<p>However, with the growing trend towards electrification of energy end-"
"uses, the focus here on electricity may become less of a weakness in the "
"future and may also serve as a general indicator of the progress towards "
"greater electrification in developing counties. That, in itself, should be "
"seen as a shift towards the use of more modern technology to deliver "
"sustainable energy services.</p>\n"
"<p>Furthermore, as reflected in many national policies, plans and targets, "
"increasing the production of electricity and, in particular, renewable "
"electricity, is seen by many countries as a first priority in their "
"transition to the delivery of more modern and sustainable energy services. "
"Thus, this indicator is a useful first-step towards measuring overall "
"progress on this target that reflects country priorities and can be used "
"until other additional or better indicators can be developed.</p>"

"<h2>Treatment of missing values:</h2>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li><strong><em>At country level:</em></strong></li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>At the country level, electricity capacity data is sometimes missing for "
"two reasons:</p>\n"
"<p>1. Delays in responding to IRENA questionnaires or publication of "
"official data. In such cases, estimates are made so that global and regional "
"totals can be calculated. The most basic treatment is to repeat the value of "
"capacity from the previous year. However, IRENA also checks unofficial data "
"sources and collects data about investment projects (see Indicator 7.a.1). "
"These other sources can be used to identify if any new power plants have "
"been commissioned in a year and are used where available to update the "
"capacity value at the end of a year. Any such estimates are eventually "
"replaced by official or questionnaire data when that becomes available.</p>\n"
"<p>2. Off-grid capacity data is frequently missing from national energy "
"statistics, or is presented in non-standard units (e.g. numbers of mini-"
"hydro plants in a country rather than their capacity in MW). Where official "
"data is not available, off-grid capacity figures are collected by IRENA from "
"a wide variety of other official and unofficial sources in countries (e.g. "
"development agencies, government departments, NGOs, project developers and "
"industry associations) and this information is added to the capacity "
"database to give a more complete picture of developments in the renewable "
"energy sector in a country. This data is peer reviewed each year through an "
"extensive network of national correspondents (the REN21 Network) and is "
"checked with IRENA country focal points when they attend IRENA meetings and "
"training workshops.</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"  <li><strong><em>At regional and global levels:</em></strong></li>\n"

msgctxt "COVERAGE"
msgid ""
"<h1>Data availability</h1>\n"
"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p>The total number of capacity records in the database (all developing "
"countries/areas, all years since 2000, all technologies) is 11,000. In terms "
"of numbers of records, 3,120 (28%) are estimates and 740 (7%) are from "
"unofficial sources. The remaining records (65%) are all from returned "
"questionnaires or official data sources. </p>\n"
"<p>However, in terms of the amount of capacity covered in the database, the "
"shares of data from estimated and unofficial sources is only 5% and 1% "
"respectively. The large difference between these measures is due to the "
"inclusion of off-grid capacity figures in the database. The amount of off-"
"grid generating capacity in a country is quite frequently estimated by "
"IRENA, but the amounts of off-grid capacity recorded in each case is often "
"relatively small.</p>\n"
"<h2>Time series:</h2>\n"
"<p>Renewable generating capacity data is available from 2000 onwards. </p>\n"
"<h2>Disaggregation:</h2>\n"
"<p>IRENA&#x2019;s renewable capacity data is available for every country and "
"area in the world from the year 2000 onwards. These figures can also be "
"disaggregated by technology (solar, hydro, wind, etc.) and by on-grid and "
"off-grid capacity.</p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "COMPARABILITY"
msgid ""
"<h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>\n"
"<p>The main source of discrepancies between different sources of electricity "
"capacity data are likely to be due to the under-reporting or non-reporting "
"of off-grid capacity data (see above) or slight variations in the definition "
"of installed capacity. IRENA uses the IRES definition of capacity agreed by "
"the Oslo Group on Energy Statistics, while some countries and institutions "
"may use slightly different definitions of capacity to reflect local "
"circumstances (e.g. the reporting of derated rather than maximum net "
"installed capacity or the reporting of built rather than commissioned "
"capacity at year-end).</p>"
