"<h1>Concepts and definitions</h1>\n"
"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator fixed Internet broadband subscriptions, by speed, refers to "
"the number of fixed-broadband subscriptions to the public Internet, split by "
"advertised download speed.</p>\n"
"<p>The indicator is currently broken down by the following subscription "
"speeds:</p>\n"
"<p>- 256 kbit/s to less than 2 Mbit/s subscriptions: Refers to all fixed "
"broadband Internet subscriptions with advertised downstream speeds equal to, "
"or greater than, 256 kbit/s and less than 2 Mbit/s.</p>\n"
"<p>- 2 Mbit/s to less than 10 Mbit/s subscriptions: Refers to all fixed -"
"broadband Internet subscriptions with advertised downstream speeds equal to, "
"or greater than, 2 Mbit/s and less than 10 Mbit/s.</p>\n"
"<p>- Equal to or above 10 Mbit/s subscriptions (4213_G10). Refers to all "
"fixed -broadband Internet subscriptions with advertised downstream speeds "
"equal to, or greater than, 10 Mbit/s.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>Fixed Internet broadband subscriptions refer to subscriptions to high-"
"speed access to the public Internet (a TCP/IP connection), at downstream "
"speeds equal to, or greater than, 256 kbit/s. This includes cable modem, "
"DSL, fibre-to-the-home/building, other fixed (wired)-broadband "
"subscriptions, satellite broadband and terrestrial fixed wireless broadband. "
"This total is measured irrespective of the method of payment. It excludes "
"subscriptions that have access to data communications (including the "
"Internet) via mobile-cellular networks. It should include fixed WiMAX and "
"any other fixed wireless technologies. It includes both residential "
"subscriptions and subscriptions for organizations.</p>\n"
"<p>The Internet is a worldwide public computer network. It provides access "
"to a number of communication services including the World Wide Web and "
"carries e-mail, news, entertainment and data files.</p>"

"<h2>Description:</h2>\n"
"<p>Since data for this indicator are based on administrative data from "
"operators, no information on individual subscribers is available and "
"therefore the data cannot be broken down by any individual characteristics. "
"Data could in theory be broken down by geographic location and urban/rural, "
"but ITU does not collect this information.</p>"

msgctxt "COLL_METHOD"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>The Internet has become an increasingly important tool to provide access "
"to information, and can help foster and enhance regional and international "
"cooperation on, and access to, science, technology and innovations, and "
"enhance knowledge sharing. High-speed Internet access is important to ensure "
"that Internet users have quality access to the Internet and can take "
"advantage of the growing amount of Internet content &#x2013; including user-"
"generated content &#x2013; services and information.</p>\n"
"<p>While the number of fixed-broadband subscriptions has increased "
"substantially over the last years and while service providers offer "
"increasingly higher speeds, fixed Internet broadband can vary tremendously "
"by speed, thus affecting the quality and functionality of Internet access. "
"Many countries, especially in the developing world, have not only a very "
"limited amount of fixed-broadband subscriptions, but also at very low "
"speeds. This limitation is a barrier to the Target 17.6 and the indicator "
"highlights the potential of the Internet (especially through high-speed "
"access) to enhance cooperation, improve access to science, technology and "
"innovation, and share knowledge. The indicator also highlights the "
"importance of Internet use as a development enabler and helps to measure the "
"digital divide, which, if not properly addressed, will aggravate "
"inequalities in all development domains. Information on fixed broadband "
"subscriptions by speed will contribute to the design of targeted policies to "
"overcome those divides.</p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>Since most Internet service providers offer plans linked to download "
"speed, the indicator is relatively straightforward to collect. Countries may "
"use packages that do not align with the speeds used for this group of "
"indicators. Countries are encouraged to collect the data in more speed "
"categories so as to allow aggregation of the data according to the split "
"shown above. In the future, ITU might start to include higher-speed "
"categories, reflecting the increasing demand and availability of higher-"
"speed broadband subscriptions.</p>"

msgctxt "DATA_COMP"

"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>ITU collects data for this indicator through an annual questionnaire from "
"national regulatory authorities or Information and Communication Technology "
"(ICT) Ministries, who collect the data from national Internet service "
"providers. The data can be collected by asking each Internet service "
"provider in the country to provide the number of their fixed-broadband "
"subscriptions by the speeds indicated. The data are then added up to obtain "
"the country totals.</p>"

"<h1>Data availability</h1>\n"
"<p>Data for this indicator exist for about 90 economies (in 2015). However, "
"more countries are expected to provide information on this indicator over "
"the next few years, which will allow ITU to produce regional and global "
"estimates. Data on fixed-broadband subscriptions not broken down by speed "
"are widely available, and regional and global are being produced.</p>\n"
"<h2>Disaggregation:</h2>\n"
"<p>Since data for this indicator are based on administrative data from ISPs, "
"no information on individual subscribers is available and therefore the data "
"cannot be broken down by any individual characteristics. Data could in "
"theory be broken down by geographic location and urban/rural, but ITU does "
"not collect this information.</p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "COMPARABILITY"
msgid ""
"<h2>Sources of discrepancies:</h2>\n"
"<p>Differences between global and national figures may arise when countries "
"do not use the same definition for fixed-broadband subscriptions, or when "
"speed tiers differ. Differences for each data point will be explained in a "
"note.</p>"
