msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator expresses the number of deaths from inadequate water, "
"sanitation and hygiene (with focus on WASH services) which could be "
"prevented by improving those services and practices. It is based on both the "
"WASH service provision in the country, as well as the related health "
"outcomes, and therefore provides important information on the actual disease "
"caused by the risks measured in 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3.</p>"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>Data rely on (a) statistics on WASH services (6.1, 6.2 and 6.3), which "
"are well assessed in almost all countries, and (b) data on deaths. Data on "
"deaths are also widely available from countries from death registration data "
"or sample registration systems, which are certainly feasible systems. Such "
"data are crucial for improving health and reducing preventable deaths in "
"countries. The main limitation is that not all countries do have such "
"registration systems to date, and data need to be completed with other type "
"of information.</p>"
