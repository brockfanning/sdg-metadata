"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>Research and development (R&amp;D) expenditure as a proportion of Gross "
"Domestic Product (GDP) is the amount of R&amp;D expenditure divided by the "
"total output of the economy.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>The OECD Frascati Manual (OECD, 2015) provides the relevant definitions "
"for research and experimental development, gross domestic expenditure on "
"R&amp;D and researchers. Although an OECD manual, the application is global. "
"During the 6th revision of the Frascati Manual, developing country issues "
"were mainstreamed in the core of the Manual. The 7th edition was released in "
"October 2015.</p>\n"
"<p>The following definitions, taken from the 2015 edition of the Frascati "
"Manual are relevant for computing the indicator. </p>\n"
"<p>Research and experimental development (R&amp;D) comprise creative and "
"systematic work undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge "
"&#x2013; including knowledge of humankind, culture and society &#x2013; and "
"to devise new applications of available knowledge.</p>\n"

"<h2>Collection process:</h2>\n"
"<p>The UNESCO Institute of Statistics (UIS) sends out a questionnaire every "

"Development (OECD), Eurostat (Statistical Office of the European Union) and "
"the Network on Science and Technology Indicators &#x2013; Ibero-American and "
"Inter-American (RICYT). In agreement with these three organisations, their "
"data (which were collected from their member states/associated member states "
"&#x2013; around 65 countries-) are directly obtained from the respective "
"databases (in the case of the OECD and Eurostat) or received from the "
"partner (in the case of RICYT). There is also collaboration in Africa with "
"the African STI Indicators Initiative (ASTII) of AU/NEPAD, which may lead to "
"a joint data collection in the future. </p>\n"
"<p>For the data UIS sends a questionnaire to, the process is the following:</"

"  <li>A questionnaire is sent to focal points in countries, generally within "
