"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>Manufacturing value added (MVA) as a proportion of gross domestic product "
"(GDP) is a ratio between MVA and GDP, both reported in constant 2015 USD.</"
"p>\n"
"<p>MVA per capita is calculated by dividing MVA in constant 2015 USD by "
"population of a country or area.</p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>The gross value added measures the contribution to the economy of each "
"individual producer, industry or sector in a country. The gross value added "
"generated by any unit engaged in production activity can be calculated as "
"the residual of the units&#x2019; total output less intermediate "
"consumption, goods and services used up in the process of producing the "
"output, or as the sum of the factor incomes generated by the production "
"process (System of National Accounts 2008). Manufacturing refers to "
"industries belonging to the sector C defined by International Standard "
"Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) Revision 4, or D "
"defined by ISIC Revision 3.</p>\n"
"<p>GDP represents the sum of gross value added from all institutional units "
"resident in the economy. For the purpose on comparability over time and "
"across countries MVA and GDP are estimated in terms of constant prices in "
"USD. The current series are given at constant prices of 2015.</p>"

msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>MVA is a well-recognized and widely used indicator by researchers and "
"policy makers to assess the level of industrialization of a country. The "
"share of MVA in GDP reflects the role of manufacturing in the economy and a "
"country&#x2019;s national development in general. MVA per capita is the "
"basic indicator of a country&#x2019;s level of industrialization adjusted "
"for the size of the economy. One of the statistical uses of MVA per capita "
"is classifying country groups according to the stage of industrial "
"development.</p>"
