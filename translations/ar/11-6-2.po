"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>Air pollution consists of many pollutants, among other particulate "
"matter. These particles are able to penetrate deeply into the respiratory "
"tract and therefore constitute a risk for health by increasing mortality "
"from respiratory infections and diseases, lung cancer, and selected "
"cardiovascular diseases.</p>"

"poor for some low- and middle income areas. Furthermore, the definition of "
"urban/rural may greatly vary by country.</p>"
