"<h2>Definition:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable "
"levels measures the sustainability of the world&apos;s marine capture "
"fisheries by their abundance. A fish stock of which abundance is at or "
"greater than the level, that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) "
"is classified as biologically sustainable. In contrast, when abundance falls "
"below the MSY level, the stock is considered biologically unsustainable.</"
"p>\n"
"<h2>Concepts:</h2>\n"
"<p>Fish stock assessment science defines the long term sustainability of "
"fish resources as their abundance is fished at the level that produces the "
"maximum sustainable level. The basic benchmarks for the sustainability of "
"fisheries are set by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, "
"Article 61(3)).</p>"

"from other sources. A great effort must be made to collect data that are "
"needed for stock assessment. Also, it is worth noting that this indicator "
"cannot be directly calculated from the data, but only through stock "
"assessment which is a mathematical modelling process.</p>"

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator measure the sustainability of fish resources based on two "
"major considerations: yield and reproduction. When a stock is fished "
"biologically sustainable, it produces good yield without impairing the "
"stock&apos;s reproductivity, reaching a good balance between human use and "
"ecological conservation.</p>\n"
"<p>The proportion is just calculated based on stock numbers, without "
"weighting either by its production volume or stock abundance, that is every "
"fish stock is considered of the same importance.</p>"

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"
msgid ""
"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator measures the sustainability of fishery resources very well, "
"and is an end-result measure of Target 14.2. However, its derivation is not "
"only data hungry, but also technically demanding as it needs stock "
"assessment. This is also the reason why there is no data at country level.</"

msgctxt "DATA_COMP"
msgid ""
"<h1>Methodology</h1>\n"
"<h2>Computation method:</h2>\n"
"<p>Fishery sustainability is defined based on stock abundance. To know stock "
"abundance, one needs to carry out stock assessment that uses fish catch "
"statistics, fishing effort data and biological information and fit the data "
"to a population dynamics model. After completing stock assessment for all "
"stocks concerned, fish stocks that have abundance at or above the level "
"associated with the maximum sustainable yield are counted as biologically "
"sustainable, and otherwise are considered as overfished.</p>"

"<h2>Methods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the "
"data at the national level:</h2>\n"
"<p>The concept of&#xA0;&#x201C;within biologically sustainable "
"levels&#x201D; means that abundance of the fish stock is at or higher than "
"the level that can produce the maximum sustainable yield. </p>\n"
"<p>We estimated 584 fish stocks around world since 1974, representing 70% of "
"global landings. Each stock was estimated using the method described in FAO "
"Technical Paper 569<sup> </sup>(<a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/"
"i2389e/i2389e.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf</a>). If "
"the stock has abundance below the level that can produce maximum sustainable "
"yield, it was counted as overfished. The indicator measures the % of the "
"assessed stocks are within biologically sustainable levels. </p>\n"
"<p>However, no such assessments have been done at country level and no "
"methods and guidance of assessment at country level have been established "
"because stock assessment requires numerical modelling skills and is highly "
"data demanding so that the majority of developing countries do not have the "
"capacity of carrying out its own stock assessment.</p>"
