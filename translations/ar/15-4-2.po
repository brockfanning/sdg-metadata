"<p>The Green Cover Index is meant to measure the changes of the green "

"crop land, etc. &#x2013; in order to monitor progress on the mountain "

"cover and, as such, will provide an indication of the status of the "
"conservation of mountain environments.</p>\n"

"<p>Mountains are defined according to the UNEP-WCMC classification that "

msgctxt "RATIONALE"
msgid ""
"<h2>Rationale:</h2>\n"
"<p>The scientific mountain community recognizes that there is a direct "
"correlation between the green coverage of mountain areas and their state of "
"health, and as a consequence their capacity of fulfilling their ecosystem "
"roles. Monitoring mountain vegetation changes over time provides an adequate "
"measure of the status of conservation of mountain ecosystems. Monitoring the "
"mountain &#x201C;Green Cover Index&#x201D; over time can provide information "
"on the forest, woody and vegetal cover in general. For instance, its "
"reduction will be generally linked to overgrazing, land clearing, "
"urbanization, forest exploitation, timber extraction, fuelwood collection, "
"fire. Its increase will be due to vegetation growth possibly linked to land "
"restoration, reforestation or afforestation programmes.</p>"

msgctxt "REC_USE_LIM"

"<h2>Comments and limitations:</h2>\n"
"<p>The indicator is based on Collect Earth, the most modern technology "
"available. Its user friendliness and smooth learning curve make it a perfect "
"tool for performing fast, accurate and cost-effective assessments. It is "
"free, open source and highly customizable for the specific data collection "
"needs and methodologies. It builds upon very high resolution multi-temporal "
"images from Google Earth and Bing Maps and Landsat 7 and 8 datasets from "
"Google Earth Engine. Data and images are stored and globally available for "
"any year from 2000, making possible the monitoring of the change over time. "
"</p>\n"
"<p>The indicator has a global accuracy of 99%, but at national level for "
"small countries the degree of accuracy is lower. This will be improved over "
"time as more countries expand the data collection within their territory. </"
